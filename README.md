###Chutiyapp.com

This contains the source for chutiyapp.com

It's a website where people can have anonymous conversations with people in their locality (or any locality). Check it out. Check out the source. Go crazy. 

The following is the README for the site. 

###Gimme the basics

You can post anonymously and your posts are tagged with your location. No other data about the user is kept. Then, other people in a radius of a few kilometers (we will keep adjusting the exact radius) can see your post and comment on it. That's it!

Invite people around you to just log in, and start shooting the shit.

###What else does it do?

Honestly? Not much, and that's what we like about it. 

###That's it?

Well, okay. 

- You can change your location by clicking on your coords up there. I'm not telling you what to do with that feature. 
- You get a name for free. Use it wisely. But don't fall in love with it, everything changes.
- If you click on anyone's name in a conversation they are auto-tagged for you in the reply box
- You can format your posts with [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Again, use your awesome powers wisely.
